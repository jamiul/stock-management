# Product Catalog API with Stock Management

Product Catalog API with Stock Management, Notification System, and CI/CD Implementation

## Laravel Task:
(a) Build a REST API for a product catalog (CRUD) with minimal stock management and user authentication.

(b) Implement Caching for products to improve API performance. Integrate RabbitMQ for asynchronous processing to send email notifications when the product stock is below the minimum quantity (low stock).
## DevOps Task:
Use Docker to set up the application with MySQL and RabbitMQ. Implement a CI/CD workflow for deploying this stack to AWS or any other server. (Deployment to the server is optional, but implementing CI/CD is mandatory.)

## Nice to Have:
- Frontend visualization implemented using React.js
- Clean and maintainable code architecture
- Deployment to a production server
